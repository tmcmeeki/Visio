Revision history for Perl extension Visio.

Considerations	tomby	Mon 18 Sep 2023 07:02:25 AEST

The Visio format changed from straight XML to the OPC convention c. 2013.
There are some sample scripts on use of OPC in the example folder, e.g. vsdx.pl

Suggested approach:
a. Create a new module, e.g.Visio::OPC which handles the interaction with the 
   OPC-format file.  This would handle the read and save operations via the OPC
   module.
b. The OPC format is basically a collection of parts/relations in the form of
   XML fragments.  So LibXML is still fundamental to reading this format, e.g.
   OPC indexes all the document parts and fragments, but you need XML to pull
   the XML schemas out for the relationship IDs.
c. Retain the Visio-XML for basic operations? Or delegate the XML components.

TO-DO.

Visio Components are the items that make up the document structure.
page create
page delete
page properties
document properties

Visio Actions allow shapes to be manipulated
master (shape) add
page (shape) add
copy shape master->page
copy shape page->page (within, between)

shape properties, e.g. name, position, size
attribute assignment
